# Manipulator Plugin

This is an simple plugin to extend text manipulation in Micro.

## Keybindings

By default no keybindings exist, but you can easily modify that
in your `bindings.json` file:

```json
{
  "Ctrl-L": "manipulator.lower"
}
```

You can also execute a command which will do the same thing as
the binding:

```
> lower
```

If you have a selection, the plugin will change all of the
selection.

The following commands currently exists:

- `upper`: UPPERCASE
- `lower`: lowercase
- `reverse`: Reverses
- `base64enc`: Base64 encodes
- `base64dec`: Base64 decodes
- `rot13`: ROT-13
- `incNum`: Increase number by one
- `decNum`: Decrease number by one
- `capital`/`title`: Capitalize First Letter
- `camel`: compressesToCamelCase
- `snake`: compresses_to_snake_case
- `brace`: Adds brackets around selection
  - `curly`: Curly brackets (`{ }`)
  - `square`: Square brackets (`[ ]`)
  - `angle`: Angle brackets (`< >`)
  - `dquote`: Double quotes (`" "`)
  - `squote`: Single quotes (`' '`)
